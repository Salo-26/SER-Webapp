This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model using TensorFlow Lite, specifically designed for deployment on microcontrollers like the Arduino Nano BLE33. The model is trained on the RAVDESS dataset and can recognize seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.
